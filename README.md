neural-networks-deep-learning
=============================

In this repo, there's some code I wrote to learn the fundamentals of Deep
Learning. To finish an on-line course on this subject, I had to complete 4
programming assignments. My solution to the corresponding problems is in the
Jupyter notebooks listed below:

* [Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset](https://github.com/mwoitek/neural-networks-deep-learning/blob/master/Week%202/Logistic%20Regression%20as%20a%20Neural%20Network/Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset_v6a.ipynb)
* [Planar Data Classification with a Hidden Layer](https://github.com/mwoitek/neural-networks-deep-learning/blob/master/Week%203/Planar%20data%20classification%20with%20one%20hidden%20layer/Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer_v6c.ipynb)
* [Building Your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step](https://github.com/mwoitek/neural-networks-deep-learning/blob/master/Week%204/Building%20your%20Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Step%20by%20Step/Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step_v8a.ipynb)
* [Deep Neural Network Application](https://github.com/mwoitek/neural-networks-deep-learning/blob/master/Week%204/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20Application:%20Image%20Classification/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Application%20v8.ipynb)
