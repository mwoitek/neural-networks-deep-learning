neural-networks-deep-learning
=============================

In this repo, there's some code I wrote to learn the fundamentals of Deep
Learning. To finish an on-line course on this subject, I had to complete 4
programming assignments. My solution to the corresponding problems is in the
Jupyter notebooks listed below:

* [Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset](x)
* [Planar Data Classification with a Hidden Layer](x)
* [Building Your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step](x)
* [Deep Neural Network Application](x)
