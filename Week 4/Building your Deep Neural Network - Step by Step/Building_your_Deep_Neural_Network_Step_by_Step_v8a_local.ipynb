    "through the necessary steps. Here is an outline of this assignment, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize the parameters for a two-layer network and for an $L$-layer neural\n",
    "network.\n",
    "- Implement the forward propagation module (shown in purple in the figure\n",

    "     - Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's forward propagation step (resulting\n",
    "in $Z^{[l]}$).\n",

    "L-1) and add a [LINEAR->SIGMOID] at the end (for the final layer $L$). This\n",
    "gives you a new L_model_forward function.\n",
    "- Compute the loss.\n",
